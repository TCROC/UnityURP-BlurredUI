# Unity URP - Blurred UI Material

#### Can not get blurred/translucent UI elements working?
#### This is simple, modified UI shader that blurs geometry.

**Note**:
*-Objects are blured without post processing applied to them.
-This shader ignores transparent objects and can not stack, meaning it can not blur UI underneath it.
These functionalities might be added later.
